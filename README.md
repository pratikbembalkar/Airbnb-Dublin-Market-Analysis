# Airbnb-Dublin-Market-Analysis

This project is based on a real-world take-home assignment for data science roles at Airbnb.

The objective is to analyze Airbnb’s market activity in Dublin by understanding the gap between guest demand and host supply. A new city manager for Dublin is seeking actionable insights to improve the number and quality of bookings.

Using two datasets — guest searches and guest-host contacts — the analysis focuses on:

Understanding guest search behavior (stay dates, number of nights, room types, price ranges, etc.).

Analyzing patterns in host acceptance of guest inquiries.

Identifying gaps where guest demand is not being met by host supply.

Recommending strategies to align host offerings with guest expectations.

Suggesting additional data that could enhance future market analyses.

The project emphasizes a structured approach to data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and business-driven insights, demonstrating the complete data science workflow from raw data to strategic recommendations.
